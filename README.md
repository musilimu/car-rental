# Car Rental Information System

This repository contains our project for the **Advanced Web Technologies** module (ITLAW701) for the Level seven, Year Three, IT Option students at the ICT Department.

## Project Overview

Our project involves the development of a car rental information system. The system is designed to have two main actors: Admin and Customer. Below is the scenario of the system:

### Admin Features

1. Admin logs in
2. Admin changes a password
3. Admin adds a new car
4. Admin can view cars
5. Admin can delete and update a car
6. Admin logs out

### Customer Features

1. Customer logs in
2. Customer changes password
3. Customer views cars
4. Customer logs out

## Instructions

- We will use any version control system (GitHub or 000webhost etc) to deploy our web-based application.
- Pagination will be implemented in our web-based application.
- We will use `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` for password security.
